## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
css-example/
├── CSS/
│   └── style.css  # Contains all the CSS styles for the project
├── index.html      # The main HTML file that displays the project
└── README.md       # This file, providing an overview of the project
```

- The **CSS** folder contains the `style.css` file, where all the styles for this example are defined.
- The **index.html** file is the main file that brings together all of the HTML structure.

## Usage

### Modifying Styles
To customize the styles of the project, edit the `style.css` file located in the `CSS/` folder. You can change the layout, colors, typography, spacing, and other CSS properties as per your requirements.

### Updating Content
To change the content of the page, you can modify the `index.html` file. This includes updating the text in paragraphs, headers, and other HTML elements.

### Customizing the Form
The contact form in the HTML is currently set to not submit to any back-end service. If you want to make the form functional, you can integrate it with a back-end service or form handler, such as [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) or a custom server-side solution.
